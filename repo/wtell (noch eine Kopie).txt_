WILHELM TELL.




ACT I.

SCENE I.

     A high, rocky shore of the lake of Lucerne opposite Schwytz.
     The lake makes a bend into the land; a hut stands at a short
     distance from the shore; the fisher boy is rowing about in his
     boat.  Beyond the lake are seen the green meadows, the hamlets,
     and arms of Schwytz, lying in the clear sunshine.  On the left
     are observed the peaks of the Hacken, surrounded with clouds; to
     the right, and in the remote distance, appear the Glaciers.  The
     Ranz des Vaches, and the tinkling of cattle-bells, continue for
     some time after the rising of the curtain.

FISHER BOY (sings in his boat).
Melody of the Ranz des Vaches.

     The clear, smiling lake wooed to bathe in its deep,
     A boy on its green shore had laid him to sleep;
               Then heard he a melody
                 Flowing and soft,
               And sweet, as when angels
                 Are singing aloft.
     And as thrilling with pleasure he wakes from his rest,
     The waters are murmuring over his breast;
               And a voice from the deep cries,
                 "With me thou must go,
               I charm the young shepherd,
                 I lure him below."

HERDSMAN (on the mountains).
Air.--Variation of the Ranz des Vaches.

               Farewell, ye green meadows,
                 Farewell, sunny shore,
               The herdsman must leave you,
                 The summer is o'er.
     We go to the hills, but you'll see us again,
       When the cuckoo is calling, and wood-notes are gay,
     When flowerets are blooming in dingle and plain,
       And the brooks sparkle up in the sunshine of May.
               Farewell, ye green meadows,
                 Farewell, sunny shore,
               The herdsman must leave you,
                 The summer is o'er.

CHAMOIS HUNTER (appearing on the top of a cliff).
Second Variation of the Ranz des Vaches.

     On the heights peals the thunder, and trembles the bridge,
     The huntsman bounds on by the dizzying ridge,
               Undaunted he hies him
                 O'er ice-covered wild,
               Where leaf never budded,
                 Nor spring ever smiled;
     And beneath him an ocean of mist, where his eye
     No longer the dwellings of man can espy;
               Through the parting clouds only
                 The earth can be seen,
               Far down 'neath the vapor
                 The meadows of green.

     [A change comes over the landscape.  A rumbling, cracking
     noise is heard among the mountains.  Shadows of clouds sweep
     across the scene.

     [RUODI, the fisherman, comes out of his cottage.  WERNI, the
     huntsman, descends from the rocks.  KUONI, the shepherd, enters,
     with a milk pail on his shoulders, followed by SERPI, his assistant.

RUODI.
Bestir thee, Jenni, haul the boat on shore.
The grizzly Vale-king [1] comes, the glaciers moan,
The lofty Mytenstein [2] draws on his hood,
And from the Stormcleft chilly blows the wind;
The storm will burst before we are prepared.

KUONI.
'Twill rain ere long; my sheep browse eagerly,
And Watcher there is scraping up the earth.

WERNI.
The fish are leaping, and the water-hen
Dives up and down.  A storm is coming on.

KUONI (to his boy).
Look, Seppi, if the cattle are not straying.

SEPPI.  There goes brown Liesel, I can hear her bells.

KUONI.
Then all are safe; she ever ranges farthest.

RUODI.
You've a fine yoke of bells there, master herdsman.

WERNI.
And likely cattle, too.  Are they your own?

KUONI.
I'm not so rich.  They are the noble lord's
Of Attinghaus, and trusted to my care.

RUODI.
How gracefully yon heifer bears her ribbon!

KUONI.
Ay, well she knows she's leader of the herd,
And, take it from her, she'd refuse to feed.

RUODI.
You're joking now.  A beast devoid of reason.

WERNI.
That's easy said.  But beasts have reason too--
And that we know, we men that hunt the chamois.
They never turn to feed--sagacious creatures!
Till they have placed a sentinel ahead,
Who pricks his ears whenever we approach,
And gives alarm with clear and piercing pipe.

RUODI (to the shepherd).
Are you for home?

KUONI.
                   The Alp is grazed quite bare.

WERNI.
A safe return, my friend!

KUONI.
                           The same to you?
Men come not always back from tracks like yours.

RUODI.
But who comes here, running at topmost speed?

WERNI.
I know the man; 'tis Baumgart of Alzellen.

CONRAD BAUMGARTEN (rushing in breathless).
For God's sake, ferryman, your boat!

RUODI.
                                      How now?
Why all this haste?

BAUMGARTEN.
                     Cast off!  My life's at stake!
Set me across!

KUONI.
                Why, what's the matter, friend?
