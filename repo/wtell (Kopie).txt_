ACT I.

SCENE I.

     A high, rocky shore of the lake of Lucerne opposite Schwytz.
     The lake makes a bend into the land; a hut stands at a short
     distance from the shore; the fisher boy is rowing about in his
     boat.  Beyond the lake are seen the green meadows, the hamlets,
     and arms of Schwytz, lying in the clear sunshine.  On the left
     are observed the peaks of the Hacken, surrounded with clouds; to
     the right, and in the remote distance, appear the Glaciers.  The
     Ranz des Vaches, and the tinkling of cattle-bells, continue for
     some time after the rising of the curtain.
